                <h2>Elderly Care Service</h2>
                <p>Elderly care, often referred to as senior care, is specialized care that is designed to meet the needs and requirements of senior citizens at various stages.</p><p>We all grow old, it’s a fact of life – but this doesn’t mean we need to stop enjoying doing the things we love.
                However, with children, grandchildren and relatives leading busy working lives they can struggle to find time to provide the care that matches their parents’ and grandparents’ needs. The next obvious choice may be care homes, but at such a great cost, do you or your loved ones really want to leave their family home for an unfamiliar setting surrounding by unfamiliar people?</p>
                Karesolutions’ elderly home care service can help overcome all of these problems. An affordable alternative to a care home and a service that can relieve the stress and worry for relatives: we can care and support elderly clients with a unique care plan that will help them continue to live the lifestyle they wish. <p>With assistance from professional Care Managers, we will work with you as our esteem client and, where required or specified, your family to put in place the support that is required, along with agreed details of what support is needed and when.</p><p> Care and support packages can vary in length and content from a drop in call or safety check, through to an hour or longer. Services range from routine safety checks and prompts, to delivery of complex care and, on many occasions, simply involve providing companionship. Whatever the needs, we will always ensure the same carer team visits every time so a relationship can be established and the best care can be provided.</p>
