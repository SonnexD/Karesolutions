                <h2>Brain-Injury Care Service</h2>
                <p>No doubt, the human brain is the most vital and most complex organ of the human body. Traumatic brain injury is usually caused by a blow or other traumatic injury to the head or body. The degree of damage can depend on several factors, including the nature of the injury and the force of impact.</p> <p>Common complications that could arise from a brain injury includes: Altered consciousness such as Coma, Vegetative state, Brain death etc, Physical complications such as- Seizures, Fluid buildup in the brain (hydrocephalus), Infections, Headaches etc, Intellectual problems such as- Cognitive problems, Executive functioning problems,as well as Communication problems.</p> 
                <p>The transition from inpatient care, post brain injury, to life at home and within the community is especially stressful for everyone involved. Providing a brain injury care plan that accommodates these emotions and changes is unique for everyone, as no situation or requirements are the same.</p><p>Therefore, one of our Kare Plus specialist carers will come out and assess you or your loved one and tailor a care plan to suit their needs. Once a plan has been set, it is regularly reviewed and updated based on the progress and changing situation.</p>
                <p>The brain injury care plan will be designed to support our customers by providing person-centred care to meet their diverse and challenging requirements, aspirations and goals. By creating a stable, supporting environment, we help lay the foundations for the journey towards independent living and empowering those affected, as well as their relatives.</p>
                <p>The lives of those close to the sufferer can also be significantly affected by their injury. Family and friends have to make major adjustments and sacrifices whilst simultaneously trying to deal with the often-drastic changes in those they care for.</p>
               <p><b>For further information about the structure of our Brain Injury Care services, kindly get in touch with us today!</b></p>
