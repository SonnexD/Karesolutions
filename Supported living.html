                <h2>Supported Living Care Service</h2>
                <p>At Karesolutions Limited we help individuals with a variety of learning disabilities and complex needs live an independent life in their own home, or alongside one or two carefully matched housemates in houses and apartments sourced by Karesolutions. These homely properties can be modified to suit the clients’ needs; decorated and furnished to the individual’s and family’s taste.<p>
                <p>Our outstanding team of supported living and healthcare professionals have an excellent track record of providing flexible, high quality, person-centered care, support and enablement for people with learning disabilities, physical disabilities, acquired brain injuries and a spectrum of other needs.</p><p>As a supported living services client, as much or as little support can be provided by our trained staff. We can be on hand to help the customer catch their bus each morning or even support them in organising supported holidays and days out. No matter how we can help, we always strive to encourage independence amongst our supported living services clients, allowing them to enjoy their own choice of activities while living their lives to the full and on their own terms.</p>
                <p>Many of our customers, by simply moving into their own home causes dramatic improvements in their health and wellbeing, such as progression in mobility, language and behaviour. A one-on-one connection with regular members of the Karesolutions supported living team helps to build confidence and enhances life for both the client and their families.</p>
               <p><b>For further information about the structure of our supported Living Care services, kindly get in touch with us today!</b></p>
