                <h2>Dementia Care Service</h2>
                <p>Dementia is an overall term for diseases and conditions characterized by a decline in memory, language, problem-solving and other thinking skills that affect a person's ability to perform everyday activities. Example is Memory loss.</p> <p>Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia.
                Dementia is not a single disease; it’s an overall term — like heart disease — that covers a wide range of specific medical conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease. Disorders grouped under the general term “dementia” are caused by abnormal brain changes. These changes trigger a decline in thinking skills, also known as cognitive abilities, severe enough to impair daily life and independent function. They also affect behavior, feelings and relationships.</p>

                <p>Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60 to 80 percent of cases. Vascular dementia, which occurs because of microscopic bleeding and blood vessel blockage in the brain, is the second most common cause of dementia. But there are many other conditions that can cause symptoms of dementia, including some that are reversible, such as thyroid problems and vitamin deficiencies.</p>

                <p>Dementia is often incorrectly referred to as "senility" or "senile dementia," which reflects the formerly widespread but incorrect belief that serious mental decline is a normal part of aging.
                All types of dementia can develop behavioural patterns for clients that can be difficult for family members and friends to cope with – both physically and emotionally. Often, seeking the support of trained dementia carers is a must to help relieve the pressure of this.</p><p>We provide clients specific dementia care options that can help the client and their relatives better manage their day-to-day life and plan for the road ahead.</p>
                <p>Here at Karesolutions though, we firmly believe that having dementia does not mean the end of life as you knew it. Following the initial adaptation period, we will continue to work with the client and their family to help them continue life as normally and fulfilling as possible.</p>
                <p>There are now effective treatments and researches into dementia, you can be in the comfort of your home and get the best of our services. Be rest assured that your Karesolutions carer receives specialist on-going training and CPD to provide the highest standard of care for those with dementia.</p>
